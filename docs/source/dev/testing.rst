Testing
*******

Test-driven development has been a core principle in the creation of this API.
We have used `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ as well as various
other testing libraries from the dependencies.

All tests that guarantee correct functionality can be found
`here <https://github.com/teibit/xarray-events/tree/master/tests>`_. They are
divided into multiple files, depending on their goal.
